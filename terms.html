        <h2>Free templates</h2>
        <p>If you plan on using one of the free templates that I have available, you need to provide credit. For example: "Intro by Captainnick88 FX". If you fail to comply with these terms, any video containing the unaccredited work may be removed off YouTube.</p>
        <h2>Paid Animation</h2>
        <p>For any paid products you will be able to freely use the animations without providing credit. If you purchase an animation, please understand that I am busy and it can take several days to possibly even a few weeks to receive your introduction. I ask that you remain patient, and do not spam my email or comment section regarding your introduction. I keep track of all my orders, and have them listed in order of when they were purchased, so you will have a position in queue. If you have any questions feel free to contact me <a href="mailto:captainnick88.intros@gmail.com">here</a>.</p>
        <h2>Changes to Products</h2>
        <p>If you want me to change something within a product, it will cost $1.50 for the change of the text, $1.00 for change of color, $1.00 to remove elements of the animation, and $2.00 to add elements to the animation.</p>
